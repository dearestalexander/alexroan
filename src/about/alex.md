### Details

I started my career as a graduate at Procter & Gamble where I spent 7 years working as a member of the global projects team. During this time my focus was on developing global business services (GBS). I started out as a systems analyst working on projects to:

- Implement a global standard SAP R/3 solution across Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Africa. My focus was on a standard finance template design known as 'global core finance'
- Transition work from various countries to the EMEA shared service centre
- Develop new solutions in purchase to pay and cost accounting space
- Run process improvement initiatives for the shared service centre.

I then went on to act as a project and program manager, leading the following:

- IT outsourcing for application development and maintenance covering supply chain systems across EMEA
- Three full lifecycles of SAP R/3 implementation covering a global standard solution in finance, supply chain, customer relations management and HR
- Tax restructuring projects for a move to a regional entrepreneur, local commissionaire and toll manufacturing model
- Post-acquisition integration; covering commercials, people, process, systems and data
- Supply chain systems upgrades.

Following Procter and Gamble, I moved into management consulting where I've worked for over a decade. I've helped clients with their global business services, shared services and outsourcing initiatives and their business systems landscapes. This often involves the design of target operating models, building business cases or deeper process and systems improvement work. I've worked both for major consultin firms and on a freelance/contract basis.

Recently I've been involved in several key strategy projects incluing:

- Leading the development of a new core finance solution; including SAP CFIN, CO-PA (margin analysis) and Material Ledger
- Leading the development of a 5-year corporate strategy with executive committee members
- Leading supply chain strategy reviews
- Developing new operating models.
