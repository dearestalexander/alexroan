    <h2>Spotlight: The leadership-project team gap</h2>
    <p>I recently had a conversation about an organisation struggling with business and IT misalignment. IT were reporting a key project was delayed, but still underbudget.</p>
    <p>The project objective was the in-house development of a new ERP system. This in itself is an unusual approach in 2025 when most organisations opt for 'off the shelf' applications, often delivered on a 'software as a service' basis.</p>
    <p>In situations like this, business leaders may lack to the knowledge and experience to understand or challenge IT. Similarily in some situations IT may lack the ability to challenge business requirements.</p>
    <p>Clear communication between leadership and project teams is essential -  especially regarding objectives, benefits, scope and execution status. I explore this topic in more detail in my latest article.</p>
