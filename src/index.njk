    <h2>Spotlight: The leadership-project team gap</h2>
    </p>I recently had a conversation about the challenges a board were facing in understanding the status of an ERP transformation program. In this case the IT function were building their own custom ERP solution. The board members were unclear on why the project was both delayed but under budget. Normally you would expect a delay to be accompanied by being over budget. The conversation I had brought in this case brought to light one of the classic discussions around ERP - buy vs. build. I think buy vs. build was a bigger discussion in the past. It's more or less accepted that in most cases 'off the shelf' is better. This is a long discussion, but it allows for a leaner IT function and less complexity to manage.</p>
    <p>So it was a surprise for me to hear of a company building their own ERP in 2024/25. Further to that I couldn't guess at why they were underbudget. My only idea is that being behind schedule they hadn't made progress towards steps with specific costs. This conversation brought to mind the challenges that can happen when leadership and project teams don't have the right clarity and communication around objective/value, scope and progress and I spent some time thinking through this and putting my thoughts down on paper.
