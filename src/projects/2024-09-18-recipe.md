## Challenge Details

This was a challenge on Frontend Mentor to create a recipe card. My focus was on:

- Making use of what I think are correct HTML tags
- Ensuring CSS is well structured with block element method naming
- Making use of variables and responsive units of measure
- Testing from the begining with 320px in mind
- Adding comments to html and css to explain the approach.

No significant challenges. I did some reading on formatting list markers and the different ways to do it, and I had to look up table formatting guidelines.
