## Challenge Details

One of the challenges on Frontend Mentor is to create a four card layout. One of the purposes of the exercise is to use CSS grid. The main challenge is themed around an AI tools company. I decided to create an alternate design based on Pokemon.

Fortunately the [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us) website has lot's of images and information. They have a complete Pokédex there. I had a quick scroll through and decided to use Pikachu, Growlithe, Farfetch'd and Gyarados. Farfetch'd is one of my favourites, so funny with it's spring onion/leek stalk.
