## Challenge Details

This is the first Frontend Mentor challenge in their JavaScript path.

The JavaScript in this exercise is:

1. Use an event listener to pick up a mouse click on the share icon
2. Show a pop-up menu with links for social media platforms.

The layout of the pop up is significantly different on the wide and narrow displays. There are a variety of ways to achieve this. It was a little trickly to settle on a good solution.

- For wide screens, such as desktops, the pop-up appears next to the share button
- For narrow screens, like mobile phones, it's a banner across the bottom of the component
