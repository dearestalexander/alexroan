## Challenge Details

I thought at first glance this challenge looked straightforward, but once I got into I realised there were a few tricky points relating to the use of grid and flex and the sizing and spacing.

Some of my approaches towards sizing and spacing may not be quite in line with the best solutions, but I did find building this to be good practice and I was able to experiment further with grid.

I also enjoyed creating my own variation on the design. I was stayinig in DaNang for a few months when I worked on this and decided to base my variation on the DaNang tourism colours and logo.
