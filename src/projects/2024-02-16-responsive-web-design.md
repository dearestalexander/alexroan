## freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design

I worked through the curriculum over at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and completed the responsive web design course/certification.

One of the great things about the main curriculum at freeCodeCamp is that their website has a built in code space and terminal which let's you follow along in a 'hands-on' way as you learn. The courses are arranged into sections which have a number of exercises followed by a certification project. The exercises have anything from 10 to 100+ steps. The certification projects then give you a specification and a blank space to try and build the solution yourself.

## Course structure

Responsive web design is split into five sections with ceritification project at the end of each section.

- Survey form
- Tribute page
- Technical documentation page
- Project landing page
- Personal portfolio website

I wasn't really sure what I was doing at first, so for the survey form I just blindly copied the specification without much thought. For the remaining four projects I decided to put a bit more effort into the content and styling. I used 'Toyota' as a theme. If you've seen my classic cars web page you'll notice I've owned a number of classic Toyota cars in the past. I used the certification projects as a chance to make a few different pages about those.

When learning in general it's good for self motivation to add an interesting dimension to any exercises or projects you are working on.

## Thoughts on Responsive Web Design

The course from freeCodeCamp is an easy way to get started with HTML and CSS, however it's a bit 'hande-holdey' in that everything is broken down into very simple steps in a pre-prepared terminal. To consolidate learning it's critical to build your own projects in your own environment in parallel.

And as a bonus you get a certificate you can download and share.
