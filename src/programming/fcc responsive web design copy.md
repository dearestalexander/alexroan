description: I completed freeCodeCamp's course on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. This was way tougher than Responsive Web Design. One exercise 'building a spreadsheet app' was so hard to follow. But, overall I was impressed how much you can do with JavaScript.

Continuing with my journey through freeCodeCamp's [curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org) I've just finished been working through the JavaScript course.

JavaScript was split five sections with the following certification projects

- Building a Palindrom Checker
- Building a Roman Numeral Converter
- Building a Telephone Number Validator
- Build a Cash Register
- Build a Pokemon Search App

A lot of hours went into this. Several of the exercises had over a hundred steps. On some of the more difficult topics you'd be lucky to do more than a few steps in an hour, especially if taking the time to fully understand and experiment.

JavaScript is quite forgiving compared to lower level languages like C when it comes to type and memory management. However it has a huge range of functions to learn and a big part of it is understanding the HTML document object model.
