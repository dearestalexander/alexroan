<p>In 2022 and 2023 I spent a year working on classic cars. I had the chance to take a break from consulting work and I used that time to buy cars and trucks at auction, do some basic repairs and sell them on. It was also an excuse to enjoy driving some of the cars I love.</p>
<p>Maybe I had been watching too many of those car garage reality tv shows.</p>
<p>But seriously, I believe there are a lot of good reasons to get into classic cars.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They have more aesthetic appeal than modern cars (i.e. they look great!)</li>
  <li>You can experience a less diluted driving experience</li>
  <li>Greater safety through fewer safety devices (which are shown to increase dangerous driving)</li>
  <li>Enjoyment of the sounds and smells of old-school engines</li>
  <li>Less reliance on computers</li>
  <li>Easier self maintainance</li>
  <li>Environmental benefits â€“ avoidance of disposal & the reductions in new car manufacturing.</li>
</ul>
<p> Here are a few pictures of five of the best cars I worked on. I will hopefully get around to writing about and uploading an article about each in future</p>
