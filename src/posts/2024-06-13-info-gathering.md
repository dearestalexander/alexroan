My 4-step process to gather information for transformation projects.

Uncovering operational details is often a challenge for programs such as restructuring, process design, IT implementations and acquisitions and divestitures.

## One:request access to existing documents

### Strategy presentations

A great source of information from objectives to process details.

### Policy documents

Each area should have one. They contain key guidelines, principles and rules that operations follow.

### Organisation and people documents

Consider organisation chart, headcount data, role descriptions, and skills matrix, they also help define processes.

### Process documents

One of the best sources of details; standard operating procedures, task instructions, process issue lists. Be sure to ask for details of 'actual process' which may vary from what was originally documents.

### Reports

Request a copy of any existing operational reports. These provide metrics on process and systems performance.

### Technology documents

Consider design specifications and user manuals for systems used within different business areas. In addition the documents on IT architecture and principles may be useful.

### Data documetns

Consider data models, data libraries, and data standards for each operational area.

## Two: connect with finance to get financial metrics

As a next step discuss the project with finance, they can provide various metrics such as the total cost of a business area, the spend by category or the list of assets held.

## Three: request additional information

Surveys, questieonnaires and document requests are a good way to gather additional data. They provide:

- Flexibility for the responders to complete when they are free
- An ability to gather anonymous data, useful in some cases.

## Four: work with people

Now it's time to work with people. The key here is good preparation to maximise the use of time. Different ways to interact with people are:

- Interviews
- Workshops (brainstorming, document walkthroughs, debates)
- Sitting in on existing management meetings and work shadowing.

## Bonus: three key tips for information gathering

1. Make the most of existing documents when expert availability is limited. Be sure to ask for everything. Ask the experts for their suggestions too.
2. Get the best results from meetings and workshops. Be very well prepared with pre-reads and well thought through agendas. During the session use question lists, and sample content to structure discussions.
3. Keep track by keeping a log of questions, issues and follow up items. Add points to it as you review materials. Assign owners, target dates and next steps to ensure nothing important is forgotten.
