description: A detailed look into the technology behind blockchain as a way to understand suitable use cases.

Blockchain has been one of the most hyped technologies of the last decade thanks to the massive profits that were made from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite a lot of of the smoke and mirrors that surrounds blockchain it is a fascinating technology.

This post is based on a presentation I gave to my fellow international coleagues in Japan in 2019. I was motivated to create and deliver this presentation to combat a lot of the misinformation around blockchain solutions and when they should and shouldn’t be considered. To understand the benefits and use cases for blockchain it’s useful to understand how it works.

This requires a brief walk through of various concepts including mathematics and cryptography which have a big role in making blockchain possible. Bear with me as we work through some of the concepts it will hopefully all make sense by the end of the post.
