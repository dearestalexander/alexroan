description: Ansoff's grid is a simple, but excellent way to visualise the different options an organisation has when considering their strategy.
---

Whilst working as a consultant I’ve found this framework simple, but useful. When an organization is planning ahead it provides a way to think about the focus on current products, services and markets in alongside opportunities to developing new products/services and/or enter new markets.

![An illustration of Ansoff's grid. It's a rectangle split into four equal sections where sections are labelled as follows](/assets/images/blog/ansoff-grid__one.png)

1. Market penetration
2. Product development
3. Market development
4. Diversification

## How to use it

1. Assess the performance of your current products/service in your current market and identify opportunities for growth. There may be a wide range of ways to do. For example; new marketing campaigns and increasing sales team staffing.

2. Consider opportunities to enter new markets with existing products/services. For example; new markets may mean new geographies, or new customer groups.

3. Consider opportunities to build new products/services to sell in existing markets. Leveraging your capabilities, competitive advantage and synergies can be important here.

4. Consider opportunities for new products/services in new markets. This can be a new product/service that leverages your core business, or a shift into a completely new product and market area.

## Key considerations

- You need to start from a solid analysis of your current performance and clear understanding of your capabilities and competitive advantage
- When you think of each opportunity, consider:
  - How does it leverage your competitive advantage?
  - How does it leverage your capabilities?
  - Are there synergies?
  - What’s the level of risk?
  - What’s the feasibility?
  - It it something you can build towards with your current organization?
  - Do you need to make an acquisition to acquire knowledge, scale and customer base?
  - Ansoff helps identify opportunities and describe a potential future, but you also need to build a roadmap to get there and assess things like cost, time, resources required etc.

## Example

Consider a soft drinks company selling two soft drink brands in three countries, they may consider these options
