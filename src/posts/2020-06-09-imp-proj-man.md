Many of the projects I’ve come into contact with over the years run into problems that stem from a lack of focus in two areas. A lack of ability to effectively deal with people. And a lack of understanding of strategy.

I’ve been around projects for almost 20 years. Working in roles such as systems analyst, business analyst, project manager, program manager, management consultant and change manager. During this time I’ve seen a wide variety of project methodologies put to use, but despite this, there are consistently issues with people.

The profile of the project manager is critical to a projects success. What experience do they have? what do they focus on? what tools do they use? how do they manage conflict? a good project manager needs a wide variety of skills.

Check out the [full article](projects/imp-proj-man/) on my projects page where I look into this in detail.
