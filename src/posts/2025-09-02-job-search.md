It's time for me to start making an effort to find a new contract!

I do genuinely enjoy work, but looking for contracts is the worst. I've cleaned the house, re-designed my website, studied some online courses. Anything to avoid the dreaded job listing search!

Today, over a coffee, I was thinking about how I found past permanent and contract roles. Here are the stats:

- Network (past colleagues & managers): 4
- Agents: 3
- Internal HR reaching out: 2
- Referral by a friend: 1
- Direct application: 1 (graduate job)

I have submitted hundreds of applications over the years - mostly related to contract work, it appears they rarely work.

The key seems to be:

- Manage your network well. Be helpful, and do good work
- Build relationships with good agents.

I've always tried to do good work, though I've not always managed my network well.

Reflecting today, I’m especially grateful to colleagues and managers like Erwin Logt, Rodney Andrews, Nic Fairbank, and Nobukuni-san in Japan who’ve helped me along the way.

If anyone reading can recommend good agents, or is aware of any relevant opportunities, I'd appreciate the help. For reference my key experience is in:

- Finance transformation
- SAP project management
- Global business services and outsourcing
- Corporate and supply chain strategy.

Meanwhile, I'll try to build the courage to face the job listings!
