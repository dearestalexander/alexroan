I'd like to move from having a CV to having a personal dashboard.

Over the last few decades, business processes have been totally transformed through technology. Yet, somehow, we seem to be stuck with 'Ye Olde CV.'

As I start searching for a new role, I'm spending time looking at my CV, and I want to think carefully about:

- Where my experience helps
- What's in demand
- What I enjoy doing.

But I'm quickly reminded how difficult the CV format is.

The problem with traditional CVs:

- Data is hidden in a sea of verbosity
- Following popular advice can lead to us all sounding like exceptional CEOs
- Being too factual can read as a bit flat
- With the advancements of AI, CVs are no longer a gauge of someone's competency in professional and compelling writing.

Why not supplement your CV with a dashboard?

I decided to create a chart of key skills by years of experience. This started with a table showing roles as rows and skills as columns.

As I worked on this, I realised I can break it down into three tables. One for industries, one for functions/process areas, and the final one for skills.

The draft is now up on my page [homepage](http://www.alexroan.com)

Here's a quick ![screenshot](/assets/images/blog/cv-1.png)

I've added commentary for each bar which appears on mouseover.

This has helped me narrow my focus to three roles I'm interested in:

- Finance transformation lead/director
- SAP programme manager
- M&A operations due diligence/integration lead

This analysis gives me confidence that the top areas I'm interestedt in align well with my skills. Hopefully it will communicate that to agents and hiring managers.

If you are considering doing something similar, here's my process:

1) I used a spreadsheet to map my roles to skills
    - [Excel template](/assets/documents/cv-skills-matrix.xlsx)
2) My website is written in HTML/CSS. I used CSS grid to create charts. No complex libraries. Here's a snippet:

Does anyone else keep a personal dashboard? Has anyone else experimented with alternatives to the traditional CV?
