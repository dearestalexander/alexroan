        <h2>freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>I worked through the curriculum over at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> and completed the responsive web design course/certification.</p>
<p>One of the great things about the main curriculum at freeCodeCamp is that their website has a built in code space and terminal which let's you follow along in a 'hands-on' way as you learn. The courses are arranged into sections which have a number of exercises followed by a certification project. The exercises have anything from 10 to 100+ steps. The certification projects then give you a specification and a blank space to try and build the solution yourself.</p>
<h2>Course structure</h2>
<p>Responsive web design is split into five sections with ceritification project at the end of each section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey form</li>
<li>Tribute page</li>
<li>Technical documentation page</li>
<li>Project landing page</li>
<li>Personal portfolio website</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't really sure what I was doing at first, so for the survey form I just blindly copied the specification without much thought. For the remaining four projects I decided to put a bit more effort into the content and styling. I used 'Toyota' as a theme. If you've seen my classic cars web page you'll notice I've owned a number of classic Toyota cars in the past. I used the certification projects as a chance to make a few different pages about those.</p>
<p>When learning in general it's good for self motivation to add an interesting dimension to any exercises or projects you are working on.</p>

<h3>Product page</h3>

<h3>Portfolio page</h3>

<h2>Thoughts on Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>The course from freeCodeCamp is an easy way to get started with HTML and CSS, however it's a bit 'hande-holdey' in that everything is broken down into very simple steps in a pre-prepared terminal. To consolidate learning it's critical to build your own projects in your own environment in parallel.</p>
<p>And as a bonus you get a certificate you can download and share.</p>
