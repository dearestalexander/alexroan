      <h3>Strategy models - Ansoff&#39;s grid</h3>

      <p>by <span>Alex Roan</span> on <span>4 Oct 2024</span></p>
      <p>Whilst working as a consultant I’ve found this framework simple, but useful. When an organization is planning ahead it provides a way to think about the focus on current products, services and markets in alongside opportunities to developing new products/services and/or enter new markets.</p>

      <p>This happened to Huawei in May 2019. President Trump used an executive order to block Huawei from transacting for information or communications technology with US organisations. An obvious impact for Huawei&#39;s mobile handset business was the loss of access to Google&#39;s android platform and services. Less obvious was the loss of access to Oracle&#39;s ERP software. The impact of this may have been bigger.</p>

      <h3>Business framework</h3>
      <img src="" />
      <p>by <span>Alex Roan</span> on <span>18 Jun 2024</span></p>
      <p>One of the challenges of improving operations is identifying and prioritising where to focus. A good way to provide some structure to the approach and to improve communications is by working with a framework or map which helps to visualise the areas of the business and the nature of possible improvements.</p>

      <h3>Improving the record to report process</h3>
      <img src="" />
      <p>by <span>Alex Roan</span> on <span>18 May 2020</span></p>
      <p>Starting from business transactions such as the purchase of materials, payments to employees and sale of goods and services. Ending with reporting and decision making including the submission of detailed annual reports. The &#39;record to report&#39; process (RtR) is a long, complex process that involves people from across the enterprise. Despite the critical nature of this process, it’s rare to find RtR clearly documented from start to finish. I&#39;ve found that few finance employees can describe the complete process. In part, this is because the process touches core operational transactions (purchases, manufacturing, sales etc.). From another perspective, it&#39;s because certain parts of the process require a high level of expertise.</p>

      <h3>Can Big Business Cash In On Virtual Worlds?</h3>
      <img src="/assets/images/blog/akihabara.jpg" />
      <p>by <span>Alex Roan</span> on <span>22 Jun 2015</span></p>
      <p>$83,869,981 That is a big number. And surprisingly it is [the](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals) amount of money that Chris Robert&#39;s computer game &#39;Star Citizen&#39; has raised through crowd funding. You can pledge and buy the game for as little as $54, however if you are really into it and you have the money you can also buy [&#39;The Completionist&#39;](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Combos/The-Completionist-Digital) digital package for $18,000. What do you get for $18,000 - access to the game and pretty much all the spaceships created for the game to date. So that is $18,000 for digital spaceships in a game not yet completed. Note - you can also get all the spaceships just through playing the game.</p>

      <h3>Snapchat for Product Launch or Project Status Reporting?</h3>
      <img src="/assets/images/blog/postitnotes.jpg" />
      <p>by <span>Alex Roan</span> on <span>22 Jun 2015</span></p>
      <p>Casey Neistat on YouTube is one of my favourite channels. Casey is a self taught film maker based in New York. He frequently posts VLOGS (video logs) on youtube that offer a great insight into the lifestyle of a sociable guy who is really into creating and sharing video. I recently installed Snapchat on my phone after I heard Casey mention it in one of his YouTube VLOGS. In case you are not familiar with Snapchat, it allows you to share snaps; either photos or up to 10 second video clips, which then disapear after being viewed. One of the features of Snapchat is called stories, stories let users string snaps together to create a narrative that can be viewed for up to 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Can tools like freelance.com replace traditional professional services? I have been thinking about this in reference to management consultants, lawyers, tax advisors etc. Yesterday I listened to an [episode](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/06/how-to-get-paid-for-what-youre-good-at-with-matt-barrie/) of the James Altucher podcast which discussed this.</p>

      <h3>Tools &amp; techniques to manage business processes</h3>
      <img src="" />
      <p>by <span>Alex Roan</span> on <span>4 Jun 2015</span></p>
      <p>Working on improving business processes is popular, but sometimes organisations do the wrong things at the wrong time; spending money on process related projects which underdeliver on benefits. Often times the actual value of process work is hidden behind various technical sounding methods, tools, techniques and software. The first step to choosing the right process improvement approach is to understand some of the terminology out there. Here is a run down of various process terms, methods, tools and software followed up with some thoughts on choosing the right approach.</p>
