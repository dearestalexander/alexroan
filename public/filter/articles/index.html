      <p>Succesful large scale transformation requires a handoff and ongoing collaboration between strategy and project delivery. This often involves senior teams working with project teams. This is a crucial part of the successful delivery of complex intiiatives such as SAP S/4HANA implementation or an acquisition integration.</p>

      <p>Business transformation is a process where an organisation changes from an existing to a target operational state. Organisations spend a significant amount of effort identifying these improved target states. Corporate strategy drives this at macro level while team, department, function and business area managers are responsible for the execution at a lower level.</p>

      <p>The chart of account (CoA) is one of the most important structures in business. It reflects all the activities a business is involved in and it provides a foundation for the majority of financial and management reporting. Correct use of the chart of accounts can both simplify operations and improve decision making capability.</p>

      <p>Whenever discussing cost reduction it&#39;s important to consider corporate social responsibility as a starting point. Ideally, companies can find the right balance between reducing costs and thinking about employee and business partner (e.g. supplier) impacts. Employee layoffs can have a devastating effect on individuals. Business partner changes can put companies out of business. When planning and executing cost reduction these impacts should be considered. In real life, this might mean trying to offer employees other options (reduced hours / different contract terms / new profit-generating roles) or business partners a revised agreement.</p>

      <p>Many of the projects Iâ€™ve come into contact with over the years run into problems that stem from a lack of focus in two areas. A lack of ability to effectively deal with people. And a lack of understanding of strategy.</p>

      <p>Recent years have seen a resurgence in large organisations taking on major SAP upgrades with the relatively new SAP business suite 4 HANA (S/4HANA) collection of applications. But what exactly is HANA? and what is S/4HANA? How is implementing or upgrading to it different from the R/3 upgrades that were significant programs for many organizations over the last few decades?</p>

      <p>Blockchain has been one of the most hyped technologies of the last decade thanks to the massive profits that were made from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite a lot of of the smoke and mirrors that surrounds blockchain it is a fascinating technology.</p>
