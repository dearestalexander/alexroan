      <h1>Strategy models - Ansoff&#39;s grid</h1>
      <p class="single-post__attribution">by Alex Roan on 4 Oct 2024

      <p>Whilst working as a consultant I’ve found this framework simple, but useful. When an organization is planning ahead it provides a way to think about the focus on current products, services and markets in alongside opportunities to developing new products/services and/or enter new markets.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ansoff-grid__one.png" alt="An illustration of Ansoff's grid. It's a rectangle split into four equal sections where sections are labelled as follows"></p>
<ol>
<li>Market penetration</li>
<li>Product development</li>
<li>Market development</li>
<li>Diversification</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use it</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Assess the performance of your current products/service in your current market and identify opportunities for growth. There may be a wide range of ways to do. For example; new marketing campaigns and increasing sales team staffing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider opportunities to enter new markets with existing products/services. For example; new markets may mean new geographies, or new customer groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider opportunities to build new products/services to sell in existing markets. Leveraging your capabilities, competitive advantage and synergies can be important here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider opportunities for new products/services in new markets. This can be a new product/service that leverages your core business, or a shift into a completely new product and market area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Key considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to start from a solid analysis of your current performance and clear understanding of your capabilities and competitive advantage</li>
<li>When you think of each opportunity, consider:
<ul>
<li>How does it leverage your competitive advantage?</li>
<li>How does it leverage your capabilities?</li>
<li>Are there synergies?</li>
<li>What’s the level of risk?</li>
<li>What’s the feasibility?</li>
<li>It it something you can build towards with your current organization?</li>
<li>Do you need to make an acquisition to acquire knowledge, scale and customer base?</li>
<li>Ansoff helps identify opportunities and describe a potential future, but you also need to build a roadmap to get there and assess things like cost, time, resources required etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider a soft drinks company selling two soft drink brands in three countries, they may consider these options</p>
