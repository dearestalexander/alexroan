        <p>My 4-step process to gather information for transformation projects.</p>
<p>Uncovering operational details is often a challenge for programs such as restructuring, process design, IT implementations and acquisitions and divestitures.</p>
<h2>One:request access to existing documents</h2>
<h3>Strategy presentations</h3>
<p>A great source of information from objectives to process details.</p>
<h3>Policy documents</h3>
<p>Each area should have one. They contain key guidelines, principles and rules that operations follow.</p>
<h3>Organisation and people documents</h3>
<p>Consider organisation chart, headcount data, role descriptions, and skills matrix, they also help define processes.</p>
<h3>Process documents</h3>
<p>One of the best sources of details; standard operating procedures, task instructions, process issue lists. Be sure to ask for details of 'actual process' which may vary from what was originally documents.</p>
<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>Request a copy of any existing operational reports. These provide metrics on process and systems performance.</p>
<h3>Technology documents</h3>
<p>Consider design specifications and user manuals for systems used within different business areas. In addition the documents on IT architecture and principles may be useful.</p>
<h3>Data documetns</h3>
<p>Consider data models, data libraries, and data standards for each operational area.</p>
<h2>Two: connect with finance to get financial metrics</h2>
<p>As a next step discuss the project with finance, they can provide various metrics such as the total cost of a business area, the spend by category or the list of assets held.</p>
<h2>Three: request additional information</h2>
<p>Surveys, questieonnaires and document requests are a good way to gather additional data. They provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility for the responders to complete when they are free</li>
<li>An ability to gather anonymous data, useful in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Four: work with people</h2>
<p>Now it's time to work with people. The key here is good preparation to maximise the use of time. Different ways to interact with people are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Workshops (brainstorming, document walkthroughs, debates)</li>
<li>Sitting in on existing management meetings and work shadowing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus: three key tips for information gathering</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make the most of existing documents when expert availability is limited. Be sure to ask for everything. Ask the experts for their suggestions too.</li>
<li>Get the best results from meetings and workshops. Be very well prepared with pre-reads and well thought through agendas. During the session use question lists, and sample content to structure discussions.</li>
<li>Keep track by keeping a log of questions, issues and follow up items. Add points to it as you review materials. Assign owners, target dates and next steps to ensure nothing important is forgotten.</li>
</ol>
