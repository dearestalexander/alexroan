        <p>&quot;A practical guide to BSOs and GBS for standardisation, automation, and value delivery.&quot;</p>
<h2>Decentralised services</h2>
<p>A brief look into the past provides a clear rationale for the introduction of Business Services Organisation (BSOs).</p>
<p>A typical 1990s business had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most functions present in all locations</li>
<li>Paper based processes</li>
<li>Locally hosted IT applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn't uncommon in this set up to see mixed roles. For example, secretaries who also posted invoices.</p>
<p>This set up is inefficient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very little consistency in how things are done</li>
<li>Different information in different formats by location</li>
<li>Roles that require less than 1 full time equivalent person</li>
<li>Risk and control gaps.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-1.jpg" alt="Decentralised business"></p>
<h2>Centralised Business Services</h2>
<h3>IT: an enabler for centralisation</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s client/server enterprise resource planning (ERP) software entered the market. This was a key enabler for Business Services organisations.</p>
<p>Prior to this it was difficult to provide applications that could be accessed easily from multiple locations.</p>
<p>By the mid 90s many leading companies had started to implement ERP such as SAP R/3.</p>
<p>As ERP, the internet and various other applications gained traction physical work location became less important.</p>
<p>This was a gradual process. It took time for organisations to move away from locally hosted applications and paper processes.</p>
<p>However, from the mid to late 90s we've seen organisations shift from decentralised models to centralised Business Services models.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-2.jpg" alt="IT centralisation"></p>
<h3>Business Services organisations</h3>
<p>The first step to centralise Business Services is often done within one country.</p>
<p>These central business units are often called 'Business Services organisations'.</p>
<p>The idea is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify 'non-core' service work in each location</li>
<li>Shift it to a centrally located organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the illustration, we add a central BSO entity and shift services staff from all sites to that location. This example results in around 50 full time equivalent roles moving to a BSO.
In real-world examples single country BSOs can exceed 1,000 employees.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-3.jpg" alt="Introducing a BSO"></p>
<h2>Scoping Business Services</h2>
<p>The scope of work that moves to a BSO is flexible. It's up to each organisation to decide what is right for them.</p>
<p>When discussing this we need a way to refer to work that remains in the Business Unit and work that can shift to the BSO. I will use 'BU work' and 'BSO work'.</p>
<p>A general starting point is:</p>
<p><strong>Examples of BU work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Commercially sensitive work
<ul>
<li>Anything involving IP, USPs, secrets, specialist know how</li>
<li>Consumer market knowledge</li>
<li>Innovation and research and development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Profit generating work
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical work
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Shipping</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of BSO work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>*Customer contact centre</li>
<li>Human resources</li>
<li>Information technology</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Procurement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of debatable areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Facilities</li>
<li>Legal</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>*Customer contact centre is slightly different as this is the provision of a service directly to an external customer. Most of the the services in a BSO are services to internal Business units. However, there is no reason a BSO can’t take on customer facing services, if they fit with the strategy.</p>
<p>Opinions on this split of work vary by industry, organisation, and even an organisations current leadership team.</p>
<p>As a consultant, I've participated in several Business Services design projects. On each one, the organisations came to their own specific scope based on various factors such as objective, business model, values, culture etc.</p>
<p>There is however, a broad trend of the scope of Business Services increasing over time. This is made possible by improvements to technologies and advancements in automation and simplification.</p>
<h3>Creating a process criteria</h3>
<p>An effective way to identify the scope of work for a Business Services Organisation is to create a set of criteria to define 'BU work' and 'BSO work'.</p>
<p>Operations can then be assessed against this criteria. This will provide a draft of potential BSO scope. Popular criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial sensitivity</strong>: does it have a direct impact on innovation, revenue, profit etc. Could changes to how this process is executed have an impact on the business results</li>
<li><strong>Customer facing</strong>: does it require close contact with customers (especially face to face)</li>
<li><strong>Level of business risk</strong>: does it touch sensitive topics such as product quality, controls, or external reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Presence of issues</strong>: is the process broken, does it require workarounds, special expertise etc.</li>
<li><strong>Rule-based</strong>: can the work be done by following a set of rules; a guide, or does it require judgement</li>
<li><strong>Standardised</strong>: is the work done in a set way or are there multiple variations?</li>
<li><strong>Location dependency</strong>: does the work require interaction with physical objects or presence in a physical location</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-4.jpg" alt="Process criteria"></p>
<h3>Applying a process criteria</h3>
<p>At the initial stages of considering business services a rough estimate of scope can be made at a high level: teams or functions.</p>
<p>This can be done by combining business knowledge, business services expertise and external benchmarks.</p>
<p>This may take the form of a very simple percentage estimate of 'BU work' vs. 'BSO work' by function.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-5.jpg" alt="High level estimate"></p>
<p>In this example, I split work on whether it can be considered closer to the BU or the BSO. For the BSO work I further split it into two categories to recognise that some of the work that becomes BSO responsibility may need to be co-located with a BU for communication or governance reasons.</p>
<p>Even for a high level assessment, I would recommend going a level of detail down. For finance this may look like:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-6.jpg" alt="Next level estimate"></p>
<p>These high level estimates are useful for the initial discussions of a potential business case for a BSO. However, to validate a business case or start planning an implementation we need a more detailed scope analysis.</p>
<p>This can be done by assessing process area or roles by criteria such as the one discussed earlier, and using this as a reference to help refine percentages.</p>
<p>These illustrations are still at a high level of detail. In a real life scenario you would walk through each process area in detail with business experts. During this session you would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debate and discuss the criteria for a process</li>
<li>Consider it's suitability for centralisation</li>
<li>Discuss any issues present in the process</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-7.jpg" alt="illustration of criteria assessment"></p>
<h2>Regional Business Services</h2>
<p>In our single country BSO example we took resources from 11 sites into a central organisation. It totalled to around 50 full time equivalent (FTE).</p>
<p>Image this is repeated across multiple countries. This could easily grow to hundreds of FTE.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-8.jpg" alt="Regional Business Services"></p>
<h2>Global Business Services</h2>
<p>This brings us to Global Business Services, where global multinationals with operations in multiple time-zones implement Business Services on a global scale.</p>
<p>As the number of countries increase, the potential for scale efficiencies increase.</p>
<p>However, several challenges are introduced or become more complex:</p>
<p><strong>Languages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Business Services internal operations may need to be split by language</li>
<li>Recruiting certain languages in certain locations may be challenging</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time zones:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A single location can’t support global times zones</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Barriers to efficiencies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Business Services has to work in-line with a variety of local requirements (particularly legal).</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, global Business Services is normally delivered as a number of connected regional centres.</p>
<p>One noteworthy benefit of having multiple regional centres working together is the ability to bring 24 hour service availability on a ‘follow the sun approach’, this can be useful in cases such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round the world IT support 24x7</li>
<li>Project support 24x7</li>
<li>Late night support during finance month end.</li>
<li>Ability to share good practices globally.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-9.jpg" alt="Illustration of GBS locations"></p>
<h2>Business Services organisation model</h2>
<p>Consider an organisation consisting of three types of units: Group, Business Units, and Business Services. The role of each unit can vary across industries and organisations. In addition to the earlier discussed scoping between Business units and Business Services, there is also the question of what sits in Group. A simple split might be:</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall steering, and executive decision-making</li>
<li>External reporting and communications</li>
<li>Setting future direction, and defining policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business units:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Customer service deliver</li>
<li>Sales</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging scale and centralisation to deliver cost-efficient, quality processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process criteria can also be used to review Group processes for their suitability to shift to Business Services.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-10-0.jpg" alt="Organisation model"></p>
<p>Early organisation models for Business Services are relatively simple. They consist of a director of Business Services, function leads, and teams of operational staff. There will also be a set of support roles for the BSO itself, which manage facilities, IT infrastructure etc.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-10.jpg" alt="BSO model - basic"></p>
<h2>Service delivery management</h2>
<p>In this section, I’ll look at the basics of managing Business Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreeing services with service level agreements (SLAs) and operational level agreements (OLAs)</li>
<li>Measuring services with key performance indicators (KPIs)
– Reporting on service performance</li>
<li>Managing interactions</li>
<li>Managing organisation and people</li>
<li>Managing technology and data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms ‘effective’ and ‘efficient’ are often used when discussing Business Services, however these can be vague. I’d recommend a more direct approach: think in terms of cost and quality. Business Services should provide an agreed quality of service at a minimal cost.</p>
<p>Quality can be defined by service attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance of a process</li>
<li>Customer review score</li>
<li>Response time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost can be calculated and compared in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost incurred by Business Services</li>
<li>Cost benchmarks:
<ul>
<li>Many exist for rates such as cost of finance as a percentage of revenue, by industry/geography etc.</li>
<li>Benchmarks exist for organisations at different levels of process and systems maturity, giving indication of appropriate target costs for different situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defining services with SLAs and OLAs</h3>
<p>Service level agreements (SLAs) and operational level agreements (OLAs) provide a way to document the scope of Business Services and their expected quality levels. These are normally appended to contracts which also detail pricing, governance, and other important factors.</p>
<p>These agreements should be as detailed as possible. They should cover both planned services and potential issues and exceptions.</p>
<p>For example, a simple service level agreement for Accounts Payable may state: 1,000 invoices per month with minimum payment on time (PoT) of 95%. A more comprehensive agreement would be expanded to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of invoices by type (purchase order, approval, etc.)</li>
<li>Named critical suppliers where PoT should be 99%</li>
<li>Number of queries per month (from BU or supplier)</li>
<li>Quality on which invoices can be rejected back to suppliers</li>
<li>Number of credit memos / reversals per month</li>
<li>List of A/P related reports and KPIs to be provided</li>
<li>List of A/P review meetings the BSO should attend</li>
</ul>
<p>A detailed and clear SLA/OLA ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business units are clear on what they will and won’t receive</li>
<li>Business Services have clear information to plan their resources and work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agreements should specify the “what” and not the “how”. This provides Business Services flexibility to optimise how they deliver the service.</p>
<p>For example, there shouldn't be statements such as, “provision of 10 FTE A/P clerks”. However, this may be valid for an initial period following transition. In fact, this can be a good risk mitigation against fears of under-resourcing at the outset.</p>
<p><strong>Roles &amp; responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>In addition to service descriptions, it’s a good idea to include a matrix summarising Business Services and Business Unit roles and responsibilities in each area. Formats such as “RACI” provide a good way to see at a glance if any responsibilities are not clear.</p>
<h3>Measuring service levels with KPIs</h3>
<p>KPIs are a key part of managing quality. In general, we can split KPIs into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>KPIs that reflect overall business performance
<ul>
<li>Gross margin, asset utilisation etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KPIs that measure a specific aspect of the business</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the second category, there are various KPIs that provide a good measure of operational or process performance. These range from higher level measures to more detailed measures.</p>
<p>Consider Accounts Payable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payment on time give a broad measure of overall A/P performance, but it doesn’t necessarily help pinpoint an issue</li>
<li>Average time waiting for approval, on the other hand, gives a more actionable measure that impacts payment on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process measures like these are the foundation for monitoring operational execution.</p>
<p>Within Business Services sometimes process oriented KPIs are called process performance indicators (PPIs).</p>
<p>Some additional examples for the general ledger space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of manual journals</li>
<li>Average waiting time for business approvals</li>
<li>Number of reversals</li>
<li>Number of restatements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misuse of KPIs</strong></p>
<p>KPIs can have unintended consequences.
A classic example: posting sales at month end and reversing at the start of the next month as a way to meet monthly sales targets.</p>
<p>In Business Services, there are various ways KPIs can drive poor quality. An example is a service request being closed with reasons such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requester didn’t answer their phone</li>
<li>Workaround in place</li>
<li>Request filled with incorrect category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real world service quality should always be prioritised over simply meeting a KPI. This is critical in order to maintain good relations between Business Services and Business Units.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to control for KPI misuse. One is to ensure plenty of qualitative feedback is captured. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue service surveys</li>
<li>Hold periodic service review meetings</li>
<li>Utilise ‘secret customer’ style testing</li>
<li>Provide operational staff the ability to add explanatory commentary to KPI reports</li>
<li>Ensure process issues and input quality are captured alongside KPI measures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Service level reporting</h3>
<p>The format and content of service level reports should be agreed as part of the contract and SLAs/OLAs.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there should be quantitative measures and qualitative comments against each service.</p>
<p>Reporting should include the performance of both Business Services and Business Units in their respective responsibilities. This is where having a “RACI” matrix as part of the SLA/OLA can help.</p>
<p>Written reports can be issues on a periodic basis, followed by service review meetings. It’s good practice to hold successive meetings at increasing levels of seniority, open issues that can’t be resolved at one level can move to the next meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operational teams</li>
<li>Working groups (by various topics)</li>
<li>Management</li>
<li>Steering committee / leadership</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to periodic reporting, business systems can be set up to produce self-service reports on KPI performance in real-time.</p>
<h3>Managing interactions and escalations</h3>
<p>Interactions between Business Services and Business units can quickly become complex. Examples of typical interactions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of agreed processes:
<ul>
<li>Journal posting request</li>
<li>Emergency payment request</li>
<li>Master data creation request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ad hoc requests:
<ul>
<li>Request for a one-time report</li>
<li>Request to expedite an invoice payment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues (process, data, IT, security, governance)
<ul>
<li>Incorrect tax rate applied to posting</li>
<li>Unable to logon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Service status, reporting, governance meetings</li>
<li>Continuous improvement/change project meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these request may involve multiple roles and teams. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business unit factory worker raises issue to their supervisor</li>
<li>Supervisor contacts their operational counterpart at the BSO</li>
<li>BSO asks their manager for help</li>
<li>BSO manager contacts BSO IT helpdesk</li>
<li>IT helpdesk escalates to 2nd level support</li>
<li>2nd level IT support contacts process owner</li>
<li>And so, on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds crazy, but this happens. This chain of interactions can lead to time-delays and frustration.</p>
<p>Even with a simplified organisation model, when considering business as usual interactions, service reporting and issues and escalations, interactions start to get complex.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-15.jpg" alt="Complex interactions"></p>
<p>Suggestions on how to improve interactions:</p>
<p><strong>Set clear principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always resolve issues at the lowest level</li>
<li>Always use official contact points</li>
<li>Escalate via official procedure and contacts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assign specialist roles</strong></p>
<p>Rather than individuals from large teams interacting with individuals from other large teams, we introduce some single point of contacts, which can help with routing service information, reviews, issues, requests etc. These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business support specialists: expert level business operations team member who acts as single point of contact for service reviews, issues etc.</li>
<li>Business partners: single point of contact who represents the Business Services service line</li>
<li>Process/product owners: control the direction of processes and systems</li>
<li>Helpdesk / contact centres: single point of contact for any topic / request within an area.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Groups and committees</strong></p>
<p>As per the organisation model, business services will be structured into operational teams. These teams and their managers will provide services and prepare service reports. In addition, several other groups may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steering committee: usually cross-functional, at a senior level. Intervenes with budget and resourcing to resolve service issues.</li>
<li>Working groups: these can be set up for key services, issues or in-flight projects</li>
<li>Other committees: these may be useful to bring together individuals responsible for policy and design standards. They may act as a check and approval on service changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Escalation flow</strong>
There are many ways to design escalations. The key factor is its clear and simple. It should ensure everyone knows clearly what to do in any exception situation.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-16.jpg" alt="Interaction support roles"></p>
<p>As part of setting up a BSO, a detailed design should be created to lay out how individuals and teams interact and how escalation and governance work.</p>
<h3>Managing organisation and people</h3>
<p>From a people and organisation perspective, there are many factors to consider:</p>
<p>Culture &amp; reward</p>
<ul>
<li>Values, performance measures and reward may need to be aligned to business service delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Roles &amp; responsibilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimal staff to manager ratios to balance cost and quality</li>
<li>Design of new roles
<ul>
<li>Business Services director</li>
<li>Business support specialists and business partners</li>
<li>Regional and global product/process owners</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills &amp; capability</p>
<ul>
<li>Skills assessment and capability building for services</li>
<li>Ongoing training on Business unit activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Governance</p>
<ul>
<li>Retention plans for key individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, staff will transfer from Business units to Business Services. This needs to be carefully managed, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact with unions, governing bodies and statutory authorities</li>
<li>Direct impact on employees
<ul>
<li>Image/brand/culture</li>
<li>Career development</li>
<li>Roles and reward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing technology and data</h3>
<p>I like to separate out what I call 'critical minimum technology enablers'. This is the minimum technology required to set up a BSO. In addition to that, there is a wide range of technology that can drive cost and quality improvements. I'll cover the former now, and the latter in a future section.</p>
<p><strong>Business systems</strong></p>
<p>Business Services require access to any business systems that are used to operate Business Unit processes. Minimum changes to these systems may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New or adjusted roles and authorisations</li>
<li>Increased number of user licences</li>
<li>Adjustments to the support model</li>
<li>New or adjusted reports for service related KPIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main scenarios to consider here:</p>
<ol>
<li>IT is in scope of Business Services: they can manage this work themselves. Interacting with Group or Business Unit owners for approvals as necessary.</li>
<li>IT is not in scope of Business Services: they will require Group or Business Unit help.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, if IT outsourcing is present, this may involve service requests and contract changes with the outsourcing provider.</p>
<p><strong>Business systems add-ons</strong></p>
<p>If paper documents are used, scanning &amp; archiving will be required. This may be available within existing business systems or may require an add-on solution.
Likewise, basic workflow management may need to be added to assist with basic work routing between Business units and Business Services.</p>
<p><strong>Service management</strong></p>
<p>There are already mature, well-established IT solutions for request tracking (Jira, Service Now, etc.). These can work in a Business Services context. They can be used by Business Units to raise service requests and issues across all HR, Finance, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Performance management</strong></p>
<p>Existing business systems can be used to gather and report KPIs. The capability of existing business systems to gather, aggregate and present this information needs to be assessed. It's possible that some minimum work is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating dashboards/reports in tools like MS Excel</li>
<li>Implementation of basic dashboarding software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IT infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Basic IT set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network (WAN, LAN etc.)</li>
<li>High speed internet to data centres, BU locations, etc.</li>
<li>Desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are simply a case of extending existing IT services within the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Business Services operations</strong></p>
<p>Business Services itself will usually be at least one legal entity with its own staff, expenses, assets, etc. and will require relatively basic enterprise resource planning functionality.</p>
<p>Normally, this entity can be set up in existing systems.</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p>The condition of data and data management systems needs to be assessed prior to transition. It’s possible that some minimum work is required prior to implementing Business Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data cleansing</li>
<li>Data management systems or at minimum the implementation of basic workflow systems for requests, approvals etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementing Business Services</h2>
<p>The first step is to develop a business case and detailed operating model. If the business case is good and the operating model is feasible, then implementation work can begin. Key stages include initial set-up, first transition/pilot and then successive transition waves.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-13.jpg" alt="Implementation approach"></p>
<p><strong>Strategy: business case</strong></p>
<p>Projected costs of Business Services, projected savings in Business Units, quantification of quality improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: operating model</strong></p>
<p>The operating model includes process scope, estimated resource requirements, IT architecture, organisation model, and other key factors.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: location study</strong></p>
<p>The location study involves comparing locations based on; socio-economic factors, political stability, taxation, grants, access to resources, technical infrastructure (internet), culture, transportation (airport, roads, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Set up: facilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building/leasing</li>
<li>Office/facilities fit out (furnishing, technology etc.)</li>
<li>Maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Set up: IT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Local network, desktop, etc.</li>
<li>Set up of finance, HR, etc. for the Business Services entity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Set up: hiring managers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to any transitions, various managers may need to be recruited.</li>
<li>Operational staff can be recruited as part of transition projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transition waves</h3>
<p>At its core, transitioning work means shifting work from one location to another.</p>
<p>The state or condition of the work is important. At the outset, Business Services will only be able to operate a process to the same standard the BU operates it.</p>
<p>Processes should be assessed to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the process clearly documented and well understood</li>
<li>Are their issues present</li>
<li>Are systems fit for purpose</li>
<li>Does data meet quality standards</li>
<li>Is there are reliance on paper documents, local systems</li>
<li>Is there a high level of variation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the state of the work and Business Services quality targets, processes may be “fixed” or improved before, during, or after transition.</p>
<p>Common transition approaches:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-14.jpg" alt="transition methods"></p>
<h3>Pre-transition assessment</h3>
<p>One critical activity is the ‘assessment’ of the Business unit prior to transition. There are two main aims here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the processes are at the minimum level of stability to move to Business Services</li>
<li>Capture a baseline of the current process performance so that pre transition and post transition performance can be fairly compared.</li>
</ol>
<p>Typical assessment activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather and check process documents</li>
<li>In-person process monitoring</li>
<li>Check resource levels</li>
<li>Identify issues, problems, and workarounds</li>
<li>Measure and record current process performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Individual transitions</h3>
<p>The exact plan for a transition depends on many of the factors discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope of Business Services</li>
<li>Expected interactions</li>
<li>Minimum technology requirements</li>
<li>Pre-transition assessment work.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, one thing that transitions have in common is the shifting of work across locations and/or people. Key activities to do this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering, and updating process documents
<ul>
<li>Policies</li>
<li>Role descriptions</li>
<li>Operating procedures</li>
<li>Business systems documents (instructions, procedures, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Work handover sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering a successful transition with these alone can be challenging, additional steps that can help include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work shadowing: Business Services staff are embedded in the Business Unit and work with the processes prior to transition. Duration depends on complexity.</li>
<li>Reverse work shadowing: at the point of transition, Business Unit staff temporary sit with Business Services and oversee processing. Duration will depend on the quality of the transition work and the number of issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improving operations</h2>
<p>In order to optimise for quality and cost, Business Services should have a strong focus on improving operations. This should encompass:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy and process</li>
<li>Organisation structure, culture, and roles &amp; responsibilities</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Data</li>
</ul>
<p>Process improvement culture, including the Toyota Production Method and Lean, provide some useful guidelines on how to approach this. There is an optimal order of work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop doing work if it doesn’t deliver any value</li>
<li>Centralise work and gain labour arbitrage and scale efficiency</li>
<li>Simplify work to reduce effort, without affecting value</li>
<li>Automate work to further reduce effort</li>
<li>Improve quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automation being positioned at number 4 may seem a little surprising given increasing advancements in this area. The rationale is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We shouldn’t automate something that doesn’t deliver value</li>
<li>Automation can be expensive to implement</li>
<li>Automation has an ongoing management overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lean</strong></p>
<p>Lean is more correctly defined as a culture, than a set of tools. It fits well within Business Services by embedding and rewarding certain behaviours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t accept defects: always fix the root cause of problems. This avoids building process debt with workarounds</li>
<li>Empower anyone to identify problems. Create a continuous improvement log. Define value, and prioritise accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lean also provides some helpful tools. I will briefly cover two: the 7 wastes, and visual management boards.</p>
<p><strong>Lean 7 wastes</strong></p>
<p>Toyota identified 7 typical wastes in manufacturing. Various organisations have applied this thinking to service processes.
This provides a structure or checklist to work through when studying a process.</p>
<p>Waste is any activity that consumes resources, but creates no value for the end customer.</p>
<p>A good example in Business Services is business review reporting packs. In some organisations these can grow to +100 pages. Lean reviews of these have found that up to 80% of the data is not used for decision making.</p>
<p>Here is a further illustration of the 7 wastes for those that are interested:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-12.jpg" alt="The 7 wastes"></p>
<p><strong>Lean visual management boards</strong></p>
<p>Being focused and organised is key to delivering services well. Physical visual management boards create real spaces to bring together a variety of key information that helps focus teams and their customers on the current situation and priorities.
Boards may contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>KPIs</li>
<li>Daily contacts (e.g. duty manager approach)</li>
<li>Current known issues</li>
<li>Continuous improvement log (ideas for improvements)</li>
<li>Team charts, roles, contact names etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>KPI trend is transparent: early identification of issues</li>
<li>Promotes clear ownership</li>
<li>Focuses attention on issues</li>
<li>Reduces distraction by publicising correct</li>
<li>Continuous improvement log.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visual management boards were originally paper-based. Over the years, large monitors with real-time electronic dashboards have replaced some of these.</p>
<p>However, there is still a benefit to having tactile materials as a centre for huddles and discussions. Boards can have whiteboards installed next to them to facilitate meetings, discussions and qualitative commentary.</p>
<h2>Technology/digital</h2>
<p>I started my career in Finance IT back in 2000. At that time my employer, Procter &amp; Gamble, had just launched GBS with 3 regional service centres.</p>
<p>I recall a great presentation from one of the senior managers looking back at the previous decades of IT. I think the joke was:</p>
<ul>
<li>1960s: users made mistakes on paper</li>
<li>1970s: users made mistakes with punch cards</li>
<li>1980s: users made mistakes via mainframe terminals</li>
<li>1990s: users made mistakes on desktop PCs</li>
</ul>
<p>But IT jokes aside, what was clear even back in 2000 was how fundamentally IT was enabling and automating processes.
Things that we take for granted such as producing global harmonised accounts in a matter of days wouldn’t be possible without the automation inside ERP.</p>
<p>Looking at each decade from 1970 to 2020 there have been significant technology advances at each stage.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, we reached the point where technology could enable basic centralisation of work.</p>
<p>From the 1990s to now, various technologies have driven quality and cost improvements through automation.</p>
<p>Today, the hot topic is AI.</p>
<p>I’d define recent AI developments as a shift in automation capability from programmatic to generative. In the past, we had to set up automation based on rules. Now, AI is able to generate its own rules and decisions.</p>
<p>This is perhaps a little too much detail, but I think it's interesting to look at how technology has driven automation over the decades. Has your organisation utilised all of these?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-17.jpg" alt="Technology automation"></p>
<p><strong>1970s: Foundations of Digital Processing</strong></p>

</ul>
<h3>Digital focus area to prioritise for business shared services</h3>
<p>If I were to narrow the focus back to what is important for Business Services I would pick the following:</p>
<p>1- As expected, a strong focus on AI:</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent automation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combine process mining, RPA, and decision engines with AI to automate broader, more complex tasks.</li>
<li>The beauty of 'intelligent automation' is we can apply AI to any of other IT enabler to make it easier to implement it or to enhance it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Generative AI and predictive AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use ML/GenAI for forecasting, planning and analysis. Identifying trends and commentary</li>
<li>Apply GenAI in ad hoc and project-based work: creating templates, change communication, service survey design, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conversational AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage next-gen chatbots and virtual agents to improve user self-service, speed, and satisfaction across service request.</li>
</ul>
<p>2- But this should be coupled with leveraging core ERP:</p>
<p><strong>ERP advancements</strong></p>
<p>Modern ERP platforms (e.g. SAP S/4HANA) provide a stable digital foundation. Extend via:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web-based modular add-ons</li>
<li>Role-based UIs (e.g. SAP Fiori) for streamlined, user-specific task flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>S/4HANA also provides embedded analytics which can be used for service reporting without requiring an additional data warehouse, reporting tools or dashboards.</p>
<p>3- And finally, attention on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralised <strong>service management systems</strong> for all service requests and communications</li>
<li>Rationalised <strong>integration architecture</strong>, limit the number of IT vendors and technologies to simplify and get scale value.</li>
<li>A toolkit of <strong>process orchestration</strong> tools to help support complex process flows (e.g. onboarding, month-end close, supplier lifecycle).</li>
<li><strong>Self-service portals</strong> &amp; <strong>service catalogues</strong> to standardise and structure service requests and communications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A more comprehensive organisation model</h2>
<p>After discussing various aspects of Business Services, we can build on our basic organisation model to highlight some of the advancements in Business Services.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing scope: external services management</strong></p>
<p>Business Services have moved beyond A/P, payroll, call centre etc. One area Business Services can leverage scale on is the management of 3rd party services.</p>
<p>Organisations use 3rd party services in a variety of areas, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contract manufacturing</li>
<li>Marketing agencies</li>
<li>Lawyers (often external)</li>
<li>Independent contractors (variety of areas/roles)</li>
<li>IT outsourcing</li>
<li>Business process outsourcing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reasons to move these to Business Services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage scale to improve contract terms</li>
<li>Leverage services expertise to better manage services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increasing scope: specialist functions</strong></p>
<p>With increasing knowledge and skills coupled with technology enablers, more specialist work can move into Business Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business re-engineering: use process knowledge/culture to assist BUs with process improvement</li>
<li>Project management: Providing a central pool of professional project management resources</li>
<li>Programme management office: hosting a central PMO</li>
<li>Change management: providing a central pool of change management professionals</li>
<li>Analytics: providing centralised analytics expertise. This could range from helping Business units construct queries, through to providing data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reasons to move these to Business Services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They fit more closely with service delivery than core Business unit</li>
<li>They all benefit from a focus on service / process excellence</li>
<li>Many of them are temporary in nature. A Business Services organisation can pool resources and let them flow to BUs as required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organisation structure changes</strong></p>
<p>As part of the drive to deliver service levels at a competitive price, Business Services organisations often create teams and experts to better manage themselves internally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service delivery office: monitoring KPIs, issues etc.</li>
<li>Process owners / product teams: moving experts into permanent roles around how processes and systems work</li>
<li>Master data management: creating a master data service line to manage centralised master data management</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the industry and organisation BSOs may adapt into various areas and specialisms.</p>
<p>A migration to a Business Services model also often accompanies a move to horizontal process management. In this case areas such as finance may be replaced with for example record to report. Procurement and finance may be replaced with Purchase to pay.</p>
<p>This was very popular in the 2000s. While it improves end-to-end processes and promotes focus on outputs, it still results in silo's: just different silos. I would argue the way you manage is more important than the structure you manage.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gbs/gbs-11.jpg" alt="BSO model - advanced"></p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Business Services can deliver many benefits. The magnitude of each will depend on the organisation’s specific situation. Expected benefits should be quantified in as detailed a way as possible as part of the business case and validated with transitions.</p>
<h3>Cost savings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Labour arbitrage: varying geographic salary rates can be exploited. The same or better skills are available in locations at a lower cost</li>
<li>Co-location leads to a reduction in total management</li>
<li>Centralisation of people has an effect of organically increasing knowledge and skills, which improves the speed of service delivery</li>
<li>Centralisation reduces ‘waiting’ time related to communication and information transportation, which lowers overall process effort</li>
<li>It’s easier to deploy improvements across multiple BUs/geographies from a central location, making savings more accessible</li>
<li>Roles and salaries can be reset during the launch of a new Business Services organisation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s easier to control centralised operations. In many cases, previous cases of fraud, or reporting errors are the key driver for Business Services as opposed to cost</li>
<li>Business Services can focus solely on service delivery culture and quality and optimise for this</li>
<li>Processes can be more easily standardised in a central location which leads to more comparable reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy and change improvements</h3>
<p><strong>M&amp;A enabler</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When companies make acquisitions, they add duplicate processes and systems to their operating model. Business Services can scale expertise in how to assess M&amp;A target operations, plan for integrations and implement integrations.</li>
<li>Many organisations that grow through successive acquisitions reach a point of service bloat with no harmonisation across Business units and geographies, Business Services can be a way for them to address this moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outsourcing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a launchpad to run outsourcing from without distracting Business Units</li>
<li>Provides a central organisation to manage outsourcing parties.</li>
<li>Provides a central organisation to retain key expertise e.g. process owners, business support specialists, allowing freedom and flexibility to change outsourcing providers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business systems changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces disruption to Business Units during system implementations and upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits for the Business unit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improves their profitability by reducing costs</li>
<li>Allows them to focus on their core business</li>
<li>Reduces management overhead</li>
<li>Increases access to optional and specialist services if Business Services invest in those.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistakes and Challenges</h2>
<p>In this final section, I’ll cover challenges I’ve observed. Some of these also represent opportunities to access benefits when things are done right.</p>
<h3>1. Unrealistic cost saving targets</h3>
<p>In most cases, shifting from decentralised to centralised services will deliver a cost saving. However, there’s a risk of setting the cost saving target too aggressively. This is often the underlying cause of poor quality services and a lack of satisfaction. Creating a Business Services organisation with a insufficient budget leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understaffing: affecting operational execution and services levels</li>
<li>Underskilled / inexperienced resources: inability to deliver continuous improvements or support transformation projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an operational process moves to Business Services without any ‘fixing’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aside from labour arbitrage it will likely run at the same cost unless improvements are made (culture, process, systems, etc.)</li>
<li>In some cases, short term costs may increase, as a result of the learning period and the need to have back-up resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Broken processes, process variation &amp; the importance of a baseline</h3>
<p>If a business service organisation takes on poor processes, they will struggle to operate them well. Business Services organisations should set a minimum acceptance criteria and run a pre-transition assessment. This should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of process issues, problems and workarounds</li>
<li>Number of IT issues, problems and workarounds</li>
<li>Number of data issues, problems and workarounds</li>
<li>Level of variation: BU specific processes, BU specific systems, BU specific role definitions, BU specific data models</li>
<li>Existence of any governance or control issues</li>
<li>Extent and quality of documentation</li>
<li>Whether the documented process is followed</li>
<li>Current operational metrics</li>
<li>Volumetric measures (e.g. number of invoices)</li>
<li>Process KPIs (e.g. right first time/reversals, payment on time, number of blocked invoices)</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of an assessment should lead to a conclusion on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can Business Services operate this process? If so, with what resource level implications</li>
<li>Can Business Services gain any ‘centralisation’ benefit, or is the operation so unique it needs to be operated by a stand-alone team.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Poor management of services levels, poor use of KPIs</h3>
<p>Service levels should be carefully drafted and agreed. They need to be structured in a way that they will ensure Business units receive good service while also being achievable for the Business Services organisation.</p>
<p>There should be mechanisms in place to manage service issues at the lowest levels, avoiding unnecessary escalations. A good relationship should avoid debating contract details.</p>
<p>KPIs or process performance indicators are extremely important for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring if Business Services are meeting their quality targets</li>
<li>Measuring if Business Units meet their commitments. This often includes the quality of their requests, approvals etc.</li>
<li>They provide indicators to make management decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Staff Retention</h3>
<p>Business Services organisations may suffer from higher turnover rates than their Business Units. Note: this is an even bigger problem for outsourcers. This can present challenges with developing highly skilled staff and consistent services delivery. Some factors which may help include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Careful selection of location: skilled, experienced and willing workforce</li>
<li>Well thought out career progression opportunities</li>
<li>Work rotation within Business Services and out to the Business units.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Business Services image &amp; culture</h3>
<p>There is a risk the Business unit is considered the real business and Business Services is considered as second class. This can create various issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Attracting and retaining top talent</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to stress from the beginning that Business Services are strategic. Top performing companies have top Business Services. There are excellent opportunities for career progression within Business Services and the external market.</p>
<h3>6. Communication and interactions</h3>
<p>We touched on interaction earlier. With a lot of complexity and effort going into process, technology, and data, it’s easy to overlook this.</p>
<p>Even decently performing processes can lead to a lack of customer satisfaction if the communication doesn’t work. Simple things that can help include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-service web pages</li>
<li>FAQ pages, contact forms</li>
<li>Professional service management software</li>
<li>Real-time KPI reporting dashboards</li>
<li>Duty managers as single points of contact</li>
<li>Specialist roles, as discussed earlier: business support specialists, and business partners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Lack of Business unit accountabilities</h3>
<p>As Business units are customers of Business Services, there is a risk of focusing exclusively on the service being provided However, in order for Business Services to work effectively, the quality of inputs from Business units are important. It’s good practice to formalise this in detail at the outset. This will help avoid debates around exceptions, missed services levels, issues, etc.</p>
<p>One of the most useful tools for this is clear roles and responsibilities within the SLAs and OLAs. Using a RACI matrix can help.</p>
<h3>8. Lack of ambition</h3>
<p>1- On a geographic basis:</p>
<p>Organisations may implement country specific Business Services and gain some benefits, but miss out on larger scale benefits by shifting to regional and global services. This can be a challenge, especially for organisations with strong 'country management' or companies with concerns around cultural impacts.</p>
<p>2- On a service basis:</p>
<p>The process criteria for early Business Services was limited to rule based, repetitive work that could be easily documented. Payroll, A/P, A/R, are classic examples. However, many organisations have successfully centralised highly skilled work. For example, within finance this includes cost accounting, and financial planning and analytics. At first, it was hard to envision cost accounting being done outside the plants, but I've seen this work with zero issues. This also brings more consistency of the approach to costs across sites, countries, and regions, making profitability reporting more accurate across Business units.</p>
<h2>Future of Business Services &amp; conclusions</h2>
<p><strong>Business Services are still relevant</strong></p>
<p>At Procter &amp; Gamble, we launched global Business Services in 2000. I spent 7 years rolling it out along with helping lead process and systems improvements. The transformation that GBS delivered can’t be easily described. It helped shift P&amp;G into a truly global business from the perspective of process harmonisation, reporting consistency, etc. It’s often cited as a benchmark for global systems and Business Services.</p>
<p>Since then, up to and including recent years, I continue to come across multinational clients with fragmented, decentralised operating models. These organisations often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grew through acquisition, but never rationalised or harmonised</li>
<li>Were highly profitable and could absorb inefficient operating costs</li>
<li>Were in industries that lack services experience, and were not aware of the potential benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many organisations are leaving leaving cost savings and quality improvements on the table by not implementing BSOs/GBS.</p>
<p><strong>Business Services and AI</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen some ‘hot takes’ on LinkedIn, such as “AI will replace ERP”. As someone who focuses on Finance where accuracy and governance are key, that really made me laugh.</p>
<p>Business Services is somewhat similar, I don't see AI automating to an extent that BSOs/GBS is no longer relevant. In fact Business Services are enablers in that they can drive implementation and governance of AI better than Business Units. BSOs/GBS can lead the implementation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatbots (HR, IT especially)</li>
<li>Intelligent RPA for data entry, reconciliation, etc.</li>
<li>Gen AI across all areas:
<ul>
<li>Drafting communications</li>
<li>Analysing data, creating 1st draft commentary</li>
<li>Creating templates for projects, review meeting, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business Services and open technology standards</strong></p>
<p>One noteworthy observation is SAP moving towards role based applications based on open web standards (HTML/CSS/JS) with their Fiori apps, this is another trend that can be leveraged by Business Services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Role based applications can drive BSO/GBS cost and quality improvements</li>
<li>Open standards make it much easier to customise applications without relying on niche expensive IT skills</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Political trends</strong></p>
<p>Topics such as Brexit, Trump tariffs, etc. raise a concern around building an operating model based on centralised global and regional services. I haven’t seen tangible impacts on service industries, so I don’t see a concern here.</p>
