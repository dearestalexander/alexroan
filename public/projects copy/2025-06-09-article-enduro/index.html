<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>This is the first Frontend Mentor challenge in their JavaScript path.</p>
<p>The JavaScript in this exercise is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an event listener to pick up a mouse click on the share icon</li>
<li>Show a pop-up menu with links for social media platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>The layout of the pop up is significantly different on the wide and narrow displays. There are a variety of ways to achieve this. It was a little trickly to settle on a good solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>For wide screens, such as desktops, the pop-up appears next to the share button</li>
<li>For narrow screens, like mobile phones, it's a banner across the bottom of the component</li>
</ul>
