<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>This is a challenge on <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a> to build a newsletter form. The objective is to allow users to::</p>
<ul>
<li>Add their email and submit the form</li>
<li>See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form</li>
<li>See form validation messages if:</li>
<li>The field is left empty</li>
<li>The email address is not formatted correctly</li>
<li>View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size</li>
<li>See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
</ul>
<h2>My build/design</h2>
<p>I built this mobile first, with some media queries to make adaptations to desktop layout.</p>
<p>The JavaScript is fairly simple, the most complex part is using a regular expression (regex) to check the e-mail format.</p>
<p>Other than those, it just takes some time to get the design right.</p>
<p>To switch between form and submission confirmation pages I use display: hide. I do need to go back and ensure that these elements are labelled correctly from an accessibility perspective.</p>
