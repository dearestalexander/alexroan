<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>This was a challenge on Frontend Mentor to create a recipe card. My focus was on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making use of what I think are correct HTML tags</li>
<li>Ensuring CSS is well structured with block element method naming</li>
<li>Making use of variables and responsive units of measure</li>
<li>Testing from the begining with 320px in mind</li>
<li>Adding comments to html and css to explain the approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>No significant challenges. I did some reading on formatting list markers and the different ways to do it, and I had to look up table formatting guidelines.</p>
