<h2>Implementation checklist for S/4HANA Public Cloud</h2>
<p>I've created an end-to-end reference guide for SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud implementations.</p>
<p>I worked through SAP's 12-hour implementation learning journey and additional reference documents to capture the main implementation activities.</p>
<p>I ordered and summarised activities by SAP activate phases.</p>
<p>I then added additional steps and notes based on my experience of R/3, ECC, and S/4HANA project management as well as broader finance transformation.</p>
<p>Even trying to be concise, this high level list of activities reached 639 lines, which showcases the complexities of these programs. In a real world scenario each phase would be broken down into a more detailed plan with detailed deliverables, workshops, sign-offs, etc.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="/assets/documents/s4hana/imp-s4hana-cld-pub-v1.xlsx">Download the Excel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Key points for the interpretation of the list:</p>
<p><strong>Activities will vary widely depending on organisation size and complexity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller/simpler organisations with minimal developments would be able to filter out a lot of activities</li>
<li>On the other hand, a larger, more complex organisation, may need to consider all points, and break many down into more detail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've included a number of change management activities. However, many change activities come from situation specific change impacts.</li>
<li>Change impacts analysis should lead to the addition of more specific steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Validations and sign-offs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validations and sign-offs are critical for SAP programs</li>
<li>Scope, requirements, design options, and build should be carefully scrutinised and validated. Many additional steps can be added to put more rigour on this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A checklist doesn't quite capture the importance of a correctly resourced team.</li>
<li>SAP experts must be involved with solid knowledge of in scope modules</li>
<li>Business experts must be involved with solid knowledge of the existing business process, systems, data, and reports</li>
<li>Other specialists may be needed (data, integration, developers, roles, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considering or implementing S/4HANA public cloud I'd be interested in your thoughts on this.</p>
