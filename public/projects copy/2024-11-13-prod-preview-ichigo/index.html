<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>One of the responsive design challenges on <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.com">Frontend Mentor</a> is a simple product preview card. The trick with this design is the image changes position between narrow screens and wider screens.</p>
<p>This allows for good utilisation of the wider space on laptops and desktops by including a larger image side-by-side with the product text. For narrow screens on tablets and mobiles the image moves to the top and the text flows below.</p>
<p>In addition to moving the text this challenge utiises the 'picture' element in HTMl and the 'srcset' attributes. These allow you to provide different images for different device sizes. A simple approach to images across device sizes is to shrink the image down, but in this case detail may become hard to see. With 'picture' you can provide a large image for devices with large screens and provde a cropped image for devices with smaller screens. This allows you to crop in on detail that you'd like to be visible on smaller devices.</p>
<p>The specification in the Frontend Mentor challenge is a product card for Perfum. After completing this design I decided to create a character card for Ichigo from the anime called Bleach. Instead of 'Add to Cart' I just labelled the button 'Add to favourites'.</p>
<p>Bleach was a very popular anime back in the day with around 260 episodes. I watched them all. Over the last few years they came back with some new seasons. The final arc. It's like meeting an old friend seeing Ichigo on the TV again!</p>
