<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>I thought at first glance this challenge looked straightforward, but once I got into I realised there were a few tricky points relating to the use of grid and flex and the sizing and spacing.</p>
<p>Some of my approaches towards sizing and spacing may not be quite in line with the best solutions, but I did find building this to be good practice and I was able to experiment further with grid.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed creating my own variation on the design. I was stayinig in DaNang for a few months when I worked on this and decided to base my variation on the DaNang tourism colours and logo.</p>
