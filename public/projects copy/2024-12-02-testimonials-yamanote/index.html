<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<p>Frontend Mentor had a bunch of links to really good materials on CSS grid. Thanks to that, it wasn't that difficult to get this design right.</p>
<p>In addition to using grid for the main layout I found grid useful to align the headshot images with the names and role texts.</p>
<p>In general I found grid is a little more predictable than flex for quick use. Sometimes flex behaves in unexpected ways when it comes to alignment and wrapping. I also found grid to be a little more concise.</p>
<p>My alternate design for this challenge is the Yamanote line in Tokyo. One of my favourite train lines. I love the green colours. It also stops at a lot of the famous stations in Tokyo. I did a mock up of the design in Figma before building it with HTML and CSS.</p>
