</ul>
<p>My responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrospective</p>
<p>Assessing target acquisitions in the early stages is challenging given the lack of access to data. However, a surprising number of insights can be captured from basic financials and publicly available data</p>
<h3>Danone</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/experience/danone.png" alt="Danone Logo"></p>
<p>Dates: September 2020 to March 2022

<p>What I delivered:</p>

</ul>
<p>Retrospective</p>
<p>It's extremely challenging to implement Material Ledger and CO-PA in an existing ECC system with complex intercompany flows and custom developments. A successful CFIN implementation requires a well-designed data model and set of mapping rules. Resolving initial interface errors is a significant effort.</p>
<h3>Persol</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/experience/persol.svg" alt="Persol Logo"></p>
<p>Dates: June 2019 to November 2019

<li>Final strategy documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrospective</p>
<p>This project was a great experience. The executive board were good to work with and my Deloitte project team delivered good work. To build organic growth plans, competitor insights were key. Accessing these was difficult. Analysing strategic acquisitions involved a huge research effort. Building a plan for a new digital start up was very interesting. We looked at several successful start-ups in detail. Work process centralisation appeared as a potential opportunity for significant cost savings.</p>

We also ran a strategic review and looked at pan-Asia sourcing, as well as details of their planning and production performance.</p>

<li>More than $100m cost savings identified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrospective:</p>
<p>Coca-Cola in Japan is a fascinating business due to the massive volume of vending machines. They have a large operation and were interested to expand their business services organisation, including an element of offshoring. This was a great opportunity to investigate offshoring capabilities across Asia. Offshoring is less mature in Japan than Europe, and this came with various cultural challenges. Change management was key in this engagement.</p>

</ul>
<p>Retrospective:</p>
<p>The finance operation for a consulting business is a little different from standard finance operations, and the partnership based leadership model made this challenging in terms of gaining consensus on the future design and FTE allocation.</p>

</ul>
<p>Solution retrospective</p>
<p>This was a fascinating opportunity to work with a group finance team as part of the critical activity of closing the year-end books and preparing the annual report. This is especially complex in financial services, where it takes significant effort to produce and optimise the balance sheet. A major challenge was gaining buy in from group finance on the benefits of programme management and formalised work tracking tools.</p>

In this project, I was able to learn advance business process model and notation (BPMN), and identify key areas for process improvement within financial services finance.</p>
<h3>Johnson Matthey</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/experience/jm.png" alt="JM Logo"></p>
<p>Dates: November 2012 to February 2013

<ul>
<li>Contract successfully signed with Accenture</li>
</ul>
<p>Retrospective:</p>
<p>As is common, the systems integrators definition of scope and deliverables was light and incomplete. This may have led to a misunderstanding about expected work and complexity of required solutions. In addition, this was an interesting opportunity to understand the challenges of tracking precious metal values through chemical processes.</p>
<h3>PricewaterhouseCoopers</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/experience/pwc.png" alt="PwC Logo"></p>
<p>Dates: September 2008 to June 2012
Role: Senior Manager

<p>One complexity at Heineken was finding the right in/out of scope balance for regional shared services. This is always something that needs to be adjusted based on an organisation's culture and values. Another complexity at Heineken was the finance systems architecture and the alignment and prioritisation of work between the finance and IT functions.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation roadmap</li>

<p>Retrospective:</p>
<p>In comparison with other finance target operating model projects, the insurance industry faces the challenge of a high number of interfaces from insurance front-office systems into the general ledger.

As overall programme manager, I had to invest significant time on steering the project team on technical organisation, process and systems issues, while also investing significant time in managing stakeholders' communication. This was a big learning experience in the gap of awareness and understanding between project teams and senior managers.</p>

<p>Retrospective:</p>
<p>This was my first truly 'big' project management experience. This was a fantastic program. The Balkans business were a delight to work with.
