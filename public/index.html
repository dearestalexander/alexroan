        <p>The data model for finance has changed considerably from SAP R/3 to S/4HANA. These changes have provided some simplification while also making it easier to access data. Understanding the basics of the model can be useful. This article walks through the data model with a real life example.</p>

        <p>Succesful large scale transformation requires a handoff and ongoing collaboration between strategy and project delivery. This often involves senior teams working with project teams. This is a crucial part of the successful delivery of complex intiiatives such as SAP S/4HANA implementation or an acquisition integration.</p>

        <p>The chart of account (CoA) is one of the most important structures in business. It reflects all the activities a business is involved in and it provides a foundation for the majority of financial and management reporting. Correct use of the chart of accounts can both simplify operations and improve decision making capability.</p>

        <p>Recent years have seen a resurgence in large organisations taking on major SAP upgrades with the relatively new SAP business suite 4 HANA (S/4HANA) collection of applications. But what exactly is HANA? and what is S/4HANA? How is implementing or upgrading to it different from the R/3 upgrades that were significant programs for many organizations over the last few decades?</p>

        <p>Starting from business transactions such as the purchase of materials, payments to employees and sale of goods and services. Ending with reporting and decision making including the submission of detailed annual reports. The &#39;record to report&#39; process (RtR) is a long, complex process that involves people from across the enterprise. Despite the critical nature of this process, it’s rare to find RtR clearly documented from start to finish. I&#39;ve found that few finance employees can describe the complete process. In part, this is because the process touches core operational transactions (purchases, manufacturing, sales etc.). From another perspective, it&#39;s because certain parts of the process require a high level of expertise.</p>
