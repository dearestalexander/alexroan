    <h2>Spotlight: The leadership-project team gap</h2>
    </p>I recently had a conversation about the challenges a board were facing in understanding the status of an ERP transformation program. In this case the IT function were building their own custom ERP solution. The board members were unclear on why the project was both delayed but under budget. Normally you would expect a delay to be accompanied by being over budget. The conversation I had brought in this case brought to light one of the classic discussions around ERP - buy vs. build. I think buy vs. build was a bigger discussion in the past. It's more or less accepted that in most cases 'off the shelf' is better. This is a long discussion, but it allows for a leaner IT function and less complexity to manage.</p>
    <p>So it was a surprise for me to hear of a company building their own ERP in 2024/25. Further to that I couldn't guess at why they were underbudget. My only idea is that being behind schedule they hadn't made progress towards steps with specific costs. This conversation brought to mind the challenges that can happen when leadership and project teams don't have the right clarity and communication around objective/value, scope and progress and I spent some time thinking through this and putting my thoughts down on paper.

        <p>Succesful large scale transformation requires a handoff and ongoing collaboration between strategy and project delivery. This often involves senior teams working with project teams. This is a crucial part of the successful delivery of complex intiiatives such as SAP S/4HANA implementation or an acquisition integration.</p>

        <p>Business transformation is a process where an organisation changes from an existing to a target operational state. Organisations spend a significant amount of effort identifying these improved target states. Corporate strategy drives this at macro level while team, department, function and business area managers are responsible for the execution at a lower level.</p>

        <p>The chart of account (CoA) is one of the most important structures in business. It reflects all the activities a business is involved in and it provides a foundation for the majority of financial and management reporting. Correct use of the chart of accounts can both simplify operations and improve decision making capability.</p>

        <p>Recent years have seen a resurgence in large organisations taking on major SAP upgrades with the relatively new SAP business suite 4 HANA (S/4HANA) collection of applications. But what exactly is HANA? and what is S/4HANA? How is implementing or upgrading to it different from the R/3 upgrades that were significant programs for many organizations over the last few decades?</p>

        <p>Starting from business transactions such as the purchase of materials, payments to employees and sale of goods and services. Ending with reporting and decision making including the submission of detailed annual reports. The &#39;record to report&#39; process (RtR) is a long, complex process that involves people from across the enterprise. Despite the critical nature of this process, it’s rare to find RtR clearly documented from start to finish. I&#39;ve found that few finance employees can describe the complete process. In part, this is because the process touches core operational transactions (purchases, manufacturing, sales etc.). From another perspective, it&#39;s because certain parts of the process require a high level of expertise.</p>
